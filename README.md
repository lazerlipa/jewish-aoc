# Jewish AOC

Browser extension to use Jewish words instead of Christian ones in Advent of Code.

Enjoy doing Advent of Code but it's the wrong religion for you? No more! Install this add-on and experience the regular AoC, with a Jewish twist. Help the Rebbe and his Chassidim earn 50 Chanuka candles in time for Chanuka with the Shul Calendar of Code.

Functionally, all this does is switch out words on the page for different words. No data is sent or received from any server.

Install it for *Firefox* here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/jewish-advent-of-code/

I will happily publish it for Chrome or Safari if someone sponsors the fee.
